# Web-Based-IRS-of-Academic-Papers-with-Automatic-Tagging-using-Text-Network
This repository contains the project developed by students from the Technological University of the Philippines, Manila, which aims to create a Web-Based Information Retrieval System (IRS) for academic papers. The system is designed using React for the front end and Python for backend processing.


## Project Overview
The system allows for the upload of academic research papers in PDF format. The process involves several steps:

- PDF Upload:
A research paper (IT, CS, IS, BAS-LT) is uploaded.
Text Extraction:

- Extract text from the PDF using a text extraction library (e.g., PymuPDF).
Regex-Based Tagging:

- Identify and tag course and department names using regular expressions.
Keyword Matching (CHED CMO):

- Match and tag keywords from the CHED Memorandum Order in the extracted text.
Contextual Embedding with BERT:

- Use BERT to generate contextual embeddings for understanding the meaning of words and sentences, capturing relationships and context between terms.
Synonym Detection:

- Detect synonyms using BERT embeddings and WordNet to tag similar terms (e.g., "AI" = "artificial intelligence").
Relationship Mapping with BERT:

- Use BERT embeddings to identify and map relationships between the tagged keywords, courses, departments, and CMO terms.
Organize and Store Data:



- Store all tagged terms, synonyms, and relationships in a structured format (e.g., JSON or a database) for future reference or analysis.

## Tagging Process in Text Network
The tagging process operates within a text network, where the extracted text is analyzed to establish connections among various terms. Each term, such as keywords, courses, and departments, is represented as a node within this network. The relationships between nodes are defined based on their contextual embeddings generated by BERT.

- Nodes: Represent terms (e.g., keywords, courses, synonyms).
- Edges: Represent relationships or connections between terms based on similarity and context.
Through this network structure, the system can efficiently identify and relate tags, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how terms interact. This enables better retrieval and categorization of academic papers based on their content.

The system will utilize text networks and possibly BERT models for natural language processing, ensuring that the tagging process is both accurate and automated. The aim is to streamline how academic research is stored and accessed within the university system.
