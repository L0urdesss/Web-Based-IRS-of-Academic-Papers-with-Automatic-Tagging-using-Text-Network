# Web-Based-IRS-of-Academic-Papers-with-Automatic-Tagging-using-Text-Network
## This repository contains the code for a Web-Based Information Retrieval System (IRS) designed for managing and automatically tagging academic papers. The system uses React for the frontend and Python for the backend.

# System Overview
## The system allows users to upload academic papers (in PDF format) and automatically tags them based on the content of the papers. It leverages text network analysis and machine learning techniques to identify relevant keywords and categorize the papers according to courses like IT, IS, BAS-LT, and CS.

Key Features:

- PDF Upload: Users can upload academic papers.
- Automatic Tagging: The system analyzes the text from the uploaded documents and generates relevant tags (e.g., course, department).
- Text Network Analysis: It applies Text Network (TextNets) to extract and map relationships between key concepts in the text.
- BERT-based NLP: Uses a pre-trained language model (BERT) for semantic understanding of the paper's content.
