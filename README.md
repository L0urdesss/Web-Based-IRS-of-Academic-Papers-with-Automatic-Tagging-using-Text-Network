# Web-Based-IRS-of-Academic-Papers-with-Automatic-Tagging-using-Text-Network
This repository contains the project developed by students from the Technological University of the Philippines, Manila, which aims to create a Web-Based Information Retrieval System (IRS) for academic papers. The system is designed using React for the front end and Python for backend processing.

## Tagging Process in Text Network
The tagging process operates within a text network, where the extracted text is analyzed to establish connections among various terms. Each term, such as keywords, is represented as a node within this network. The relationships between nodes are defined based on the similarity and co-occurrence of terms within the document.

- Nodes: Represent terms (e.g., keywords).
- Edges: Represent relationships or connections between terms based on how often they appear together and their contextual relevance.
This network structure allows the system to efficiently identify and relate tags, enabling a more sophisticated understanding of how terms interact. This improves the retrieval and categorization of academic papers based on their content.

By utilizing the text network, the system can automatically analyze and tag the entire extracted content of the paper, ensuring an accurate and streamlined approach to managing academic research within the university system.
